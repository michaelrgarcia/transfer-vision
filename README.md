## Technical Details

Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Backend: 2 Express.js APIs hosted on AWS Lambda / API Gateway.

Database: Amazon DynamoDB

I will likely get around to writing the frontend in a JavaScript framework such as React or Vue. 

## Use Cases

## "I am trying to find a college where this course is offered. I would prefer to take it before I transfer."
